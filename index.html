    <h1>Find the Difference in Age</h1>
    <p>
      At the annual family gathering, the family likes to find the oldest living
      family member’s age and the youngest family member’s age and calculate the
      difference between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be given an array of all the family members' ages, in any order.
      The ages will be given in whole numbers, so a baby of 5 months, will have
      an ascribed age of 0. Return a new array with:
      <pre>[youngest age, oldest age, difference between oldest and youngest]</pre>
    </p>

    <p>Good luck!</p>
